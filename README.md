# TagScript Blockly Editor

A very basic [TagScript](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript) using [blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).

At the moment it is very buggy and incomplete. I still have several blocks to get the generator to work for. This means that not all blocks will work, and not all TagScript features have been added. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.

## Should See
  - [Original TagScript](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript)
  - [TagScript Playground](leg3ndary.github.io/bTagScriptPlayground/) (runs on a different engine than the original tagscript)
  - [Carl-Bot Documentation](https://docs.carl.gg/tags-and-triggers/ccs/) (carl's tags is what I originally made this project for)
