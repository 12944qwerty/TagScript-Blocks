# TagScript Blockly Editor

A very basic [TagScript](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript) using [blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly).

At the moment it is very buggy and incomplete. I still have several blocks to get the generator to work for. This means that not all blocks will work, and not all TagScript features have been added. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.

## Version History
### **v0.0.1**
‚Å¢ The very first release to this generator. Doesn't include much, but it's there.
  - Initial Commit
  - Autosave and autoload
  - Several blocks, including text, math, logic, lists, variables and color can be used
  - Custom args block.
  - Overwrote some math, text, and list blocks to constrain it to how TagScript uses them.
